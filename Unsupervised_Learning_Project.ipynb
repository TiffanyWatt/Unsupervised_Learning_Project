    "### 📖 1.1 Introduction  \n",
    "In today’s technology-driven world, recommender systems are socially and economically critical for ensuring that individuals can discover relevant content among overwhelming choice. Streaming platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+, and Showmax rely on recommendation algorithms to personalize user experiences, improve engagement, and reduce decision fatigue.\n",
    "\n",
    "…ever wondered how these platforms seem to know what you might like next?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we build a **hybrid recommender system** (collaborative and content-based) for a collection of anime titles. The goal is to predict **how a user will rate an unseen anime** based on their historical preferences and similarities across users and items.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains thousands of users and thousands of anime titles, collected from **myanimelist.net**, providing both **user–item interaction data** and **anime metadata**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌍 1.2 Problem Statement  \n",
    "With thousands of anime titles available across different genres, formats, and themes, users can struggle to find content that aligns with their preferences. Content platforms require intelligent systems that can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Personalize recommendations for users with diverse viewing histories  \n",
    "- Handle sparse rating data (users rate only a small subset of available titles)  \n",
    "- Make accurate predictions for anime titles a user has not yet watched  \n",
    "- Address cold-start scenarios for new users or less popular anime  \n",
    "\n",
    "This project addresses these challenges by developing a recommender system capable of accurately predicting **user ratings for unseen anime titles**, using both collaborative filtering and content-based approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 1.3 Objectives  \n",
    "- Explore and understand user–anime rating patterns and dataset sparsity  \n",
    "- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on ratings and anime metadata  \n",
    "- Build a **collaborative filtering model** using user–item interactions  \n",
    "- Build a **content-based recommender** using anime attributes such as genre and type  \n",
    "- Combine both approaches into a **hybrid recommender system**  \n",
    "- Evaluate models using rating prediction metrics such as **RMSE** and **MAE**  \n",
    "- Generate predictions for unseen user–anime pairs in `test.csv`\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 1.4 Data Source  \n",

    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Data Source  \n",
    "The dataset used in this project was sourced from **MyAnimeList.net**, a popular online platform where users track, rate, and review anime content. The data was made publicly available through a curated dataset hosted on Kaggle, which aggregates user–anime interaction data and anime metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset captures both:\n",
    "- **User behavior** (ratings assigned to anime titles), and  \n",
    "- **Item attributes** (metadata describing each anime).\n",
    "\n",
    "This dual structure makes it well-suited for developing **collaborative**, **content-based**, and **hybrid** recommender systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Data Collection Method  \n",
    "The data was originally collected through web-based aggregation of user activity on MyAnimeList.net, including user ratings and anime metadata. The Kaggle dataset provides the cleaned and structured output of this process, eliminating the need for direct API calls or web scraping within this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data is provided as static CSV files, ensuring reproducibility and consistency across analyses.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2.3 Dataset Overview  \n",
    "The dataset consists of three primary files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **anime.csv** – Contains metadata for anime titles  \n",
    "- **train.csv** – Contains historical user ratings  \n",
    "- **test.csv** – Contains user–anime pairs for which ratings must be predicted  \n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these datasets represent:\n",
    "- Thousands of unique users  \n",
    "- Thousands of unique anime titles  \n",
    "- Millions of user–anime interaction records  \n",
    "\n",
    "The ratings data is inherently **sparse**, as most users have rated only a small subset of available anime titles — a common characteristic of real-world recommender system datasets.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Data Types and Features  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Anime Metadata (`anime.csv`)\n",
    "This file contains **categorical**, **numerical**, and **text-based** features, including:\n",
    "- Categorical: anime type (TV, Movie, OVA, ONA, etc.)\n",
    "- Textual: genre labels\n",
    "- Numerical: number of episodes, average rating, number of members\n",
    "\n",
    "These features are primarily used for **content-based filtering** and cold-start scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### User Ratings (`train.csv`)\n",
    "This file contains:\n",
    "- Discrete numerical ratings (0–10 scale)\n",
    "- User and item identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "A rating value of **-1** indicates that a user watched an anime but did not explicitly rate it. These entries require special handling during preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prediction Targets (`test.csv`)\n",
    "This file contains only user and anime identifiers. The absence of ratings makes it the target dataset for generating predictions using trained recommender models.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.5 Data Suitability for Unsupervised Learning  \n",
    "The dataset is well-suited for unsupervised and semi-supervised learning approaches due to:\n",
    "- The absence of explicit labels beyond user ratings  \n",
    "- High-dimensional user–item interaction space  \n",
    "- Natural clustering of users and items based on preferences  \n",
    "- Availability of auxiliary content features for similarity-based modeling  \n",
