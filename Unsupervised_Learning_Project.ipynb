    "### 📖 1.1 Introduction  \n",
    "\n",
    "In today’s technology-driven world, recommender systems are socially and economically critical for helping users discover relevant content within increasingly large and complex catalogues. Streaming platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+, and Showmax rely on recommendation algorithms to personalise user experiences, improve engagement, and reduce decision fatigue.\n",
    "\n",
    "…ever wondered how these platforms seem to know what you might like next?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we explore and evaluate **recommender system approaches** for a collection of anime titles. The primary objective is to predict **how a user will rate an anime they have not yet reviewed**, based on historical user–item interactions and anime characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset consists of thousands of users and thousands of anime titles sourced from **myanimelist.net**, providing both **user rating data** and **anime metadata**. This combination enables the application and comparison of collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🌍 1.2 Problem Statement  \n",
    "\n",
    "With thousands of anime titles available across different genres, formats, and themes, users often struggle to find content that aligns with their personal preferences. As content libraries continue to grow, manual discovery becomes impractical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Effective recommender systems must therefore be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Personalise recommendations for users with diverse viewing histories  \n",
    "- Operate effectively on **sparse rating data**, where users rate only a small fraction of available items  \n",
    "- Accurately predict ratings for anime a user has not yet watched  \n",
    "- Handle **cold-start scenarios**, where limited interaction data is available for users or anime  \n",
    "\n",
    "This project addresses these challenges by developing and evaluating recommender systems capable of predicting user ratings for unseen anime titles using collaborative and content-based approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 1.3 Objectives  \n",
    "\n",
    "The objectives of this project are to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explore and understand user–anime rating patterns and dataset sparsity  \n",
    "- Perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on user ratings and anime metadata  \n",
    "- Build **collaborative filtering models** using historical user–item interactions  \n",
    "- Build a **content-based recommender** using anime metadata features  \n",
    "- Compare recommender approaches and assess their relative strengths and limitations  \n",
    "- Evaluate model performance using rating prediction metrics such as **MAE** and **RMSE**  \n",
    "- Generate rating predictions for unseen user–anime pairs in `test.csv`  \n",

    "### 2.1 Data Source  \n",
    "The dataset used in this project was sourced from **MyAnimeList.net**, a popular online platform where users track, rate, and review anime content. The data was made publicly available through a curated dataset hosted on Kaggle, which aggregates user–anime interaction data and anime metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset captures both:\n",
    "- **User behavior** (ratings assigned to anime titles), and  \n",
    "- **Item attributes** (metadata describing each anime).\n",
    "\n",
    "This dual structure makes it well-suited for developing **collaborative**, **content-based**, and **hybrid** recommender systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Data Collection Method  \n",
    "The data was originally collected through web-based aggregation of user activity on MyAnimeList.net, including user ratings and anime metadata. The Kaggle dataset provides the cleaned and structured output of this process, eliminating the need for direct API calls or web scraping within this project.\n",

    "- **train.csv** – Contains historical user ratings  \n",
    "- **test.csv** – Contains user–anime pairs for which ratings must be predicted  \n",
    "\n",
    "Together, these datasets represent:\n",
    "- Thousands of unique users  \n",
    "- Thousands of unique anime titles  \n",
    "- Millions of user–anime interaction records  \n",

    "- Discrete numerical ratings (0–10 scale)\n",
    "- User and item identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "A rating value of **-1** indicates that a user watched an anime but did not explicitly rate it. These entries require special handling during preprocessing.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.5 Data Suitability for Unsupervised Learning  \n",
    "The dataset is well-suited for unsupervised and semi-supervised learning approaches due to the following characteristics:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The absence of explicit class labels beyond user-provided ratings  \n",
    "- A high-dimensional and sparse user–item interaction space  \n",
    "- Natural grouping of users and anime based on shared preference patterns  \n",
    "- Availability of auxiliary anime metadata that supports similarity-based modelling  \n",
    "\n",
    "These characteristics enable the use of techniques such as **cosine similarity**, **collaborative filtering**, and **content-based recommendation** to uncover hidden patterns in user preferences and predict unseen ratings.\n"

    "\n",
    "The exploratory data analysis revealed several important characteristics of the anime dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "- User rating behaviour is highly uneven, with most users rating only a small number of anime titles  \n",
    "- Anime popularity follows a long-tail distribution, where a small number of titles receive most ratings  \n",
    "- The user–anime rating matrix is highly sparse, a common challenge in recommender systems  \n",
    "- Numerical features such as `episodes`, `members`, and `rating` vary significantly in scale \n",
    "\n",
    "These findings are particularly relevant for recommender systems, as they confirm that traditional rule-based or popularity-only approaches would be insufficient. The observed sparsity and variation in user behaviour motivate the use of collaborative and content-based filtering techniques to infer unseen user preferences."

    "\n",
    "Recommender systems aim to predict user preferences by analysing past behaviour or item characteristics.  \n",
    "In this project, two primary approaches are explored:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Collaborative Filtering** – based on similarities between users or items  \n",
    "- **Content-Based Filtering** – based on similarities between anime attributes  \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modelling Approach and Implementation Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommender system models are introduced conceptually using dense representations to clearly illustrate the underlying prediction logic.  \n",
    "For evaluation and final rating prediction, **sparse matrix implementations are used** to ensure computational feasibility on large and highly sparse user–item datasets.\n",

    "#### 7.4.2 Interpretation of Results\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **baseline model**, which predicts the global average rating, provides a useful lower bound but lacks personalisation and produces the highest error among all approaches.\n",
    "- **User-based collaborative filtering** improves slightly over the baseline by leveraging similarities between users, but its performance is limited by data sparsity and scalability constraints.\n",
    "- **Item-based collaborative filtering** achieves the **lowest MAE and RMSE**, indicating significantly better predictive accuracy. This suggests that user preferences are more consistently captured through similarities between anime titles rather than between users.\n",
    "- **Content-based filtering** performs better than the baseline and user-based collaborative filtering, particularly benefiting from anime metadata. However, its accuracy is limited by the expressiveness of the available content features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.4.3 Key Insights\n",
    "\n",
    "- Collaborative filtering methods outperform the baseline, demonstrating the value of learning from historical user–item interactions.\n",
    "- Item-based collaborative filtering provides the best balance between **accuracy, scalability, and stability**, making it the most effective model in this project.\n",
    "- Content-based filtering remains valuable for **cold-start scenarios**, even though its predictive accuracy is lower than the item-based approach.\n",
    "- These results highlight the importance of selecting an appropriate recommender strategy based on dataset characteristics and practical constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7.4.4 Selected Model for Final Predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on evaluation results, **item-based collaborative filtering** is selected as the final model for generating rating predictions on the unseen test dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This choice is supported by its superior performance across both MAE and RMSE metrics and its suitability for large-scale recommendation problems."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This project investigated the use of recommender system techniques to predict user ratings for unseen anime titles. Using a dataset sourced from myanimelist.net, multiple approaches were explored, including user-based collaborative filtering, item-based collaborative filtering, and content-based filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploratory data analysis revealed a highly sparse and high-dimensional user–item interaction space, motivating the use of similarity-based recommendation methods. Collaborative filtering models were constructed to leverage historical rating patterns, while content-based filtering utilised anime metadata to address cold-start scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model performance was evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) on a validation subset. Among the evaluated approaches, **item-based collaborative filtering achieved the strongest predictive performance**, substantially outperforming both the baseline global mean model and alternative recommender methods. This suggests that user preferences are more consistently captured through similarities between anime titles than through similarities between users in this dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Content-based filtering demonstrated reasonable performance and proved valuable for scenarios where limited interaction data is available, although its accuracy was constrained by the simplicity of available content features. User-based collaborative filtering provided personalised predictions but was limited by scalability and sparsity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this project demonstrates that item-based collaborative filtering offers the most effective balance between accuracy, scalability, and robustness for the given dataset. The final model was successfully applied to generate rating predictions for unseen user–anime pairs, completing an end-to-end recommender system pipeline from data exploration to final prediction."
